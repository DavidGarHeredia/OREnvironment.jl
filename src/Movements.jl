# flip value
# symmetric value... like flip but from lb to ub
# replace.. it is a simple add and update
# swap two values
# inverse (inverse the order of all elements between x_i and x_j) 
# insert (put element x_j in position i) # check if Julia is faster by default 
# insert_sequence = move a whole seq instead of just one element like insertion
