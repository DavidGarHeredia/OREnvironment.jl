# insert (put element x_j in position i) # check if Julia is faster by default 
# insert_sequence = move a whole seq instead of just one element like insertion
# movements for permutation problems 
# LK algorithm
# 2-opt
# 3-opt
# 4-opt
# ejection chains
# OR procedure: insert 3 nodes in a row, then 2 and then 1... 
					# we change when local optimal is reached
